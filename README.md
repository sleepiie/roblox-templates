Roblox wants to replace the classic baseplate after 12 years. Let's preserve everything.

## Why did you make this?

If the 12-year-old baseplate is replaced, a large part of Roblox history will be lost forever. I want to preserve this part of Roblox history. Also, I prefer the baseplate just because of its simplicity, and I would hate to have to remove all of the lighting effects etc every time I start a new game.
